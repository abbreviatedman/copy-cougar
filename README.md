# Copy Cougar

### Introduction

Our mission today is to copy one of the following websites:

* [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/)
* [Squareup](https://squareup.com/us/en)
* [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/)
* [Monster](https://www.monster.com/)
* [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
* [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
*  [Lokai](https://lokai.com]()
* [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) (or another website if that's fake news)
* [Medium](https://medium.com/)
* [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/)

And you'll do it using FLEXBOX.


### Guidelines

* You _must_ wireframe every single layout, AND you _must_ bring them to an instructor for approval before you can begin.
* We'll be doing this in pairs today, but in one person's repo only. That's right: it's git collaboration time in America.
* You _only_ have to copy the main page, but you _do_ have to copy past the opening viewport. In human speak: you need to copy all the way down to the bottom of the main page.
* We'll be copying every single layout available in the target page. Pay attention to how many layouts were in the original!
* Copy all text verbatim using copy-paste; if it's not selectable, take the equivalent amount of text from a lorem ipsum generator. Do _not_ screenshot it, as an image will respond differently to viewport changes than text will.
* But _do_ save or screenshot images.
* For videos, either link to the original video using a `video` tag, or simply screenshot the video and implement it as a still image.


### Stretch Goals

* Copy another page!
